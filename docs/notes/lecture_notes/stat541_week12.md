## Unsupervised Learning

Recall that in supervised learning, we have a data set $\left(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)} \right), \dots, \left(x^{(n)}, y^{(n)} \right)$ and we predict $y_*$ using $x_*$. In unsupervised learning, we no longer have $y$, and just get a data set $x^{(1)}, \dots, x^{(n)}\in \mathbb{R}^p$. The goal is to learn about the distribution of $x$'s.

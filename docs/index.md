# Welcome to My Homepage!

## My name is Haoxin Sang (Hollis).

I'm excited to share my journey as a PhD student in CS at the University of Alberta, under the guidance of [Xiaoqi Tan](https://xiaoqitan.org/). 

Here, you'll find insights into my research, experiences as an international student, and reflections on various topics in Computer Science. (1)
